# Swipe Right
(Previously Known as Tinder Math)
<p>11-12 March 2017 - Facebook HQ, London </p>

<h2>Description</h2>
Swipe right is a quiz app, users read a mathmatical statement onscreen and swipe right if it is correct and left if it is not. The app has been developed during the Facebook Hackathon London 2017.
They can create their own quizzes to fit with their topics at school and comes intergrated with Facebook, and you can share to your Facebook newsfeed. 
It was inspired by Tinder, and by our own experiences with revising for maths equations.
